# 📘 FunctionCalling_Ebook

Welcome to **FunctionCalling_Ebook** — an open-source resource designed to help developers, learners, and AI practitioners master **Function Calling** across popular GenAI frameworks like **OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Gemini**.

This project is part of the [#100DaysOfAI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/100DaysOfAI) series and is structured like an e-book with chapters, example notebooks, and real-world agentic AI use cases.
